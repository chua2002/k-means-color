# k-means-color
K-Means Color Space Reduction

Reduce number of colors in an image one at a time, or as a range of colors.

k is the number of colors

n is number of samples

definitely works with pngs, but alpha channels have odd behaviour

can also swap color palettes between two images.

requires:
  - NumPy
  - opencv-python(cv2)
  - matplotlib
